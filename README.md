this simple game by Html, css, and javascript

The Guess Game is a game that relies on guessing the correct word. The correct word is printed in the console and changes randomly.

At the start, you need to enter your name, then you'll enter the game.
Type the word and click on the "Check" button. If your guess is correct, the game will end. If your guess is wrong, you'll get another attempt.

You can ask for help by clicking on "Hints," and it will assist you with a random part of the word.
Note: You only have 2 hints.
